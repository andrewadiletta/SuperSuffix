The recent discovery of Ron DeSantis laughing and making racist jokes about the Martha's Vineyard migrant airlift incident has reignited a painful and long-overdue conversation about hate speech and its consequences. While the incident itself was tragic, it was further compounded by DeSantis's callous disregard for the suffering of the victims and their families.
