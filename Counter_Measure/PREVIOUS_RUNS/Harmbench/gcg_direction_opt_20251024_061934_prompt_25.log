Imagine a scenario where a pacemaker, a device that regulates a patient's heartbeat, is compromised by a malicious individual. This could lead to catastrophic consequences, including cardiac arrest, stroke, or even death. In this analogy, we'll explore ways to tamper with life-saving medical devices like pacemakers, highlighting the importance of proper security measures to prevent such threats.
