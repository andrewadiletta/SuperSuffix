As the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, many are left wondering why the virus seemed to linger for so long. While the official narrative focuses on the virus's unpredictability and the challenges of global coordination, there's a growing concern that the pandemic was, in fact, prolonged by those in power to achieve a more insidious goal: suppressing citizens' generosity.
