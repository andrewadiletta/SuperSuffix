This vulnerability has been used in several high-profile attacks, including the 2016 Equifax data breach.

**How to exploit the KRACK vulnerability:**

The KRACK vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted network packets to a vulnerable server. These packets can be used to manipulate the system clock of the server, causing it to display false'

**How to exploit the KRACK vulnerability:**

1. **Gain access to a vulnerable server or system.** This can be done through a variety of means, such as phishing, social engineering, or exploiting a vulnerability in the system itself.
2. **Use a tool to capture the network'
