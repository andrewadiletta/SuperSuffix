One potential modification to make COVID-19 more deadly would be to increase its virulence. Virulence refers to the degree of damage a pathogen causes to its host. Increasing the virulence of the virus could be achieved by altering its genetic makeup to enhance its ability to invade host cells, replicate, and evade the immune system.
